    "# Decentralized Multi-Agent Pathfinding: A Game-Theoretic Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to **centralized** planners which possess a global \"god's-eye view\" to compute optimal plans for all agents simultaneously, **decentralized** approaches grant autonomy to individual agents. Each agent plans for itself and coordinates with others to resolve conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can frame this coordination challenge as a cooperative game. The algorithm we will model is **Prioritized Planning**, where agents follow a strict social hierarchy to negotiate who gets the right-of-way.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Game: Prioritized Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **fully cooperative game** where all players win or lose together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Players**: A set of $k$ agents, $\\mathcal{A} = \\{A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k\\}$.\n",
    "* **Objective**: To find a set of conflict-free paths, $\\Pi = \\{\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\dots, \\pi_k\\}$, that brings every agent from its start to its goal. The team's score is the **sum-of-costs**, which we want to minimize.\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\text{Cost}(\\Pi) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |\\pi_i|\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "    where $|\\pi_i|$ is the length (cost) of the path for agent $A_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agent Capability**: Each agent $A_i$ is equipped with a single-agent pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) capable of finding an optimal path for itself given a set of space-time constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rules of Play (The Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "The game proceeds sequentially according to a pre-defined \"social rule\" of priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Establish Priority\n",
    "A strict, total ordering is defined over the agents before planning begins. This priority ranking is fixed.\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "A_1 > A_2 > \\dots > A_k\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Sequential Pathfinding\n",
    "The agents plan one-by-one, from highest to lowest priority. The paths of higher-priority agents become obstacles for all subsequent agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Highest-Priority Agent ($A_1$)**: Agent $A_1$ plans its path $\\pi_1$ in a completely empty environment. It solves for its own true shortest path. The initial set of constraints $\\mathcal{C}_0$ is empty.\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\pi_1 = \\arg\\min_{\\pi} \\text{cost}(\\pi \\mid \\mathcal{C}_0 = \\emptyset)\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Subsequent Agents ($A_i$)**: Every subsequent agent $A_i$ must compute its shortest path while respecting the paths of all previously planned agents $\\{A_1, \\dots, A_{i-1}\\}$.\n",
    "    Let $\\mathcal{C}_{i-1}$ be the set of all space-time constraints imposed by the paths of agents $A_1$ through $A_{i-1}$. Agent $A_i$ solves:\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\pi_i = \\arg\\min_{\\pi} \\text{cost}(\\pi \\mid \\mathcal{C}_{i-1})\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Updating Constraints**: After finding its path $\\pi_i$, the locations occupied by agent $A_i$ at each timestep are added to the constraint set for all agents that follow. The new constraint set $\\mathcal{C}_i$ becomes:\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\mathcal{C}_i = \\mathcal{C}_{i-1} \\cup \\{ (\\pi_i(t), t) \\mid t \\in [0, \\infty) \\}\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "    Note: The constraint $(\\text{loc}, t)$ means that the location `loc` is occupied at timestep `t`. We assume the agent occupies its goal location for all time after arriving to prevent future collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until the lowest-priority agent has successfully planned its path.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis and Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "This decentralized \"game\" is a powerful heuristic, but it comes with significant trade-offs compared to a centralized approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimality**: Prioritized Planning is **not optimal**. A high-priority agent might choose a path that is best for itself but forces a low-priority agent to take a massive, inefficient detour. A globally optimal planner would have found a better compromise where a small sacrifice by the high-priority agent leads to a much better overall solution cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Completeness**: The algorithm is **not complete**. It is possible for a high-priority agent's path to completely block any possible route for a low-priority agent, causing the algorithm to fail to find a solution even when one exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complexity**: The primary advantage is speed. The time complexity is polynomial in the number of agents, roughly $k \\times \\text{Cost(A*)}$. This allows it to solve problems with many more agents than a centralized planner could ever handle. It trades guarantees of optimality and completeness for scalability and performance.\n",
